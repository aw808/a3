				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Specific focus on when Omicron is peaking, which does show a spike in January of both 2021 and 2022 successfully</li>
				<li>Visualization aims to show trends in new Covid-19 cases in the United States</li>
				<li>Peaks and troughs: peaks in January 2021, September 2022, January 2022</li>
				<li>Generally increasing trend, spiral structure allows for time continuity</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The spiral design effectively highlights important data, making it easy to spot spikes, especially in January 2021 and January 2022. The human eye naturally focuses on the center first and follows the spiral outward, creating a logical flow for interpreting trends. This layout also allows for comparisons between the same month in different years, such as COVID-19 cases in October 2021 vs. October 2022, helping to track year-over-year changes. The use of red shading reinforces the severity of higher case counts, aligning with the intuitive association of red with danger or caution. Additionally, the legend design is creative, using a triangle to represent the ratio between 0 and 150K cases, making the scale easier to grasp. The key takeaway is clear—another spike in January is coming, which makes this visualization well-suited for publication, as it effectively communicates its main point.
			</p>
			<p>
			The spiral structure, while visually engaging, may be confusing for the target audience, as curvature and depth are not the most effective expressive channels. The direction of the graph is not immediately clear—while arrows indicate movement for each year, a more intuitive guide, such as a continuous arrow along the black spiral or a red dot marking the start at 2020, would help direct the reader’s attention. Additionally, the use of straight arrows feels unintuitive for a circular layout; curving them to match the spiral would improve readability. Another challenge is that only four months (January, April, July, October) are labeled, requiring the reader to mentally track the timeline to decipher trends for other months. Labeling all months along the radial axes using consistent three-letter abbreviations (e.g., "Apr" instead of "April") would enhance clarity without overcrowding the visualization. The spiral also creates a depth illusion, similar to staring into a tunnel, making it seem as though values near the center (2020) are "further" away than those in 2022, which can distort perception of trends. This depth effect, combined with the circular layout, makes relative comparisons harder and magnitude estimation less effective than in a bar chart, where values are aligned for easy reading. The placement of the "7-day average" label in January 2021 is also unclear—it could be repositioned under the title with a brief explanation of whether it applies only to that point or across all data. Additionally, small inconsistencies, such as the uncapitalized title ("Cases") and the tight spacing between the legend and title, could be refined for better presentation. Finally, the symmetry of the shaded spiral area appears to be an aesthetic choice, but it’s unclear why it’s necessary—breaking that symmetry might even improve the visualization’s effectiveness.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
				Motivation:
To see the individual monthly data points more clearly to get a better idea of data trends
Hope to communicate:
Both monthly and yearly trends with the data in a easy to read manner
What worked well:
Compartmentalized month and year COVID-19 cases
Can clearly see the number of cases for each month of each year
By comparing horizontally and vertically, we can notice trends across years and months.
What didn’t work well:
Magnitude estimation for circles is not intuitive, but I did try to use some darker shades for redundant encoding for communicate the size.
It can be a bit overwhelming with lots of circles
To explore for next sketch:
a way to communicate trends that maintain time continuity (i.e. not breaking up over years) and looks more visually appealing

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
				Motivation:
I want the time continuity of the spiral, but without the issues with depth perception.
Hope to communicate:
A nice and intuitive circular bar chart graph that builds upon lessons learned in past sketches and critiques.
Simple colors and design for the reader to quickly see COVID-19 trends.
What worked well:
With the bar charts, it's easier to see the direct comparisons between different months.
I labeled every month around the circle for easy readability.
This visualization feels cleaner and simpler to read than the original.
The circular also looks a bit like COVID itself (red spikes) which makes it appealing for public viewing. 
What didn’t work well:
The circular structure across years makes it difficult to compare cases for the same months of different years.
The circular structure of the graph still prevents the ease of direct comparison that a straight x-axis would provide.
To explore for next sketch:
How to weigh keeping the time continuity of the graph while not sacrificing on the ability to make direct comparisons?

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        In Sketch 1, my main goal was to address critiques from earlier versions and enhance the effectiveness of the visualization. By using color contrast to differentiate arrows and years, I improved pre-attentive processing, making trends easier to follow. Additionally, curving the arrows and increasing their number reinforced the spiral’s directional flow, and the blue-highlighted years helped them stand out. While these refinements made the visualization clearer, the spiral structure still introduced issues with depth perception and trend misinterpretation. The radial axes also contributed to a cluttered appearance. Moving forward, I plan to explore an alternative visual form that enhances readability without sacrificing insight.

For Sketch 2, I aimed to make individual monthly data points more distinguishable, allowing for a clearer understanding of both monthly and yearly trends. By organizing COVID-19 case numbers in a structured grid, trends across months and years became more apparent. However, using circles for magnitude representation proved less intuitive, even with added shading for redundant encoding. Additionally, the sheer number of circles created a visual mess. To improve upon this design, I will explore a method that preserves time continuity while making trends more seamless and visually engaging.

With Sketch 3, I wanted to retain the time continuity of a spiral while avoiding depth perception issues. A circular bar chart format helped simplify comparisons across months and provided a cleaner, more intuitive design. Labeling each month around the circle improved readability, and the shape—reminiscent of COVID itself—offered a visually compelling structure. However, the circular format still limited direct comparisons between the same months across different years, which a linear x-axis would better facilitate. My next step will be to balance time continuity with improved comparative clarity, ensuring the visualization remains both insightful and aesthetically effective.


These sketches motivate me to maintain time continuity in my final sketch, communicate trends, and use tools like redundant encoding and visual pop-out to design a good visualization. 

Upon reading the spreadsheet, I was intrigued by the categories new_confirmed, new_deceased, and new_recovered. Since these columns are inherently related, I aimed to create a visualization that capitalized on their relationships. However, I needed clarification on the exact meanings of the column titles—did "deceased" imply the case had also been tested and confirmed? To better understand, I referred to the dataset’s metadata (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data/blob/main/docs/table-epidemiology.md)). I learned that new_confirmed represents cases confirmed after a positive test on that date, new_deceased refers to deaths from a positive case on that date, and new_recovered represents recoveries on that date. However, this presented a problem: recoveries and deaths listed on a given date were not necessarily from the cases confirmed that day. To align these data points in a meaningful way, I transformed the dataset so that for each date, I could track cases occurring that day along with their respective deaths and recoveries. Using CDC data (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm#:~:text=Death%20data%20are%20approximately%2065,of%20when%20the%20death%20occurred.), I found that 65% of COVID-19 patients recover in 2–3 weeks and 65% of deaths occur within 2 weeks. Since this represents a majority, I shifted recoveries and deaths back by two weeks so that each row in the dataset reflects cases on that date along with their eventual outcomes.

On June 4, 2021, there was a negative value for new confirmed cases, which indicated an adjustment to the data. However, due to a lack of information on how the adjustment was made, I replaced that value with the average of the previous and next day’s confirmed cases (June 3 and June 5, 2021) to maintain accuracy without distorting trends. I applied the same approach for March 14, 2022, which had a negative value for new deaths. Additionally, the last three months of data contained numerous missing values, errors, and negative values, making it unreliable for trend analysis, so I removed those rows to improve clarity.

Lastly, due to the large difference in scale between confirmed cases and deaths, I applied a log base 10 transformation to make trends more readable. For zero values, I set log(0) = 0 to avoid errors while preserving trends. This transformation helps balance the visualization, ensuring that all three data points—cases, recoveries, and deaths—can be interpreted effectively within the same graph.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        These decisions all facilitate effective communication by ensuring that COVID-19 case, recovery, and death trends are clearly represented and easily interpretable. The shifting of recovery and death data by two weeks helps align outcomes with their corresponding case dates, making the trends more logical. Using both lines and shaded areas for deaths and recoveries provides redundant encoding, reinforcing key information. Color choices—blue for confirmed cases, red for deaths—enhance clarity, while bold but narrow lines allow for precise trend tracking without visual clutter. The logarithmic y-axis transformation ensures that trends remain readable, though it requires viewers to understand how log scales impact relative proportions. Additionally, grey vertical lines improve month-to-month trend comparisons, even at the slight cost of a higher data-ink ratio. Direct labeling and a subtitle clarifying the time-shifted data help prevent misinterpretation. Together, these design choices balance clarity, readability, and accuracy in visualizing the progression of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.

However, some aspects of the data may be downplayed due to these design choices. Because death and recovery data were shifted back two weeks, the last two weeks of data could not be included, slightly limiting trend completeness. The log scale effectively displays trends but distorts the perceived scale of cases vs. deaths, making it possible for those unfamiliar with logarithmic transformations to misinterpret the relative magnitude of deaths and recoveries. Additionally, using a fixed two-week translation for deaths and recoveries is a necessary approximation but does not account for individual variations—some people recover faster, while others may succumb to the disease after a longer period. Given more granular data, incorporating different variants, symptoms, or recovery periods could provide a more nuanced understanding.

My final design successfully addresses many of the critiques from Step 2. It makes the reading direction clear (left to right), enables direct comparisons across months, and improves the positioning of key elements like titles, subtitles, and labels for better readability. While my design diverged significantly from the original spiral visualization, the process of “critique by redesign” was instrumental in identifying challenges in effectively presenting long-term trends without overwhelming the viewer and maintaining the ability to compare across time. However, one tradeoff is that my design does not allow for easy same-month comparisons across years—something the spiral design handled better. The spiral also had a strong focal point in the center and a more visually striking composition, making it engaging but harder to interpret at a glance. This experience highlighted that no single visualization is perfect—each design comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, and balancing tradeoffs is key to effective data visualization. Ultimately, this project reinforced the importance of audience considerations, design clarity, and iterative refinement in creating meaningful and informative visual representations of data.
