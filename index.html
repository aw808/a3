				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Specific focus on when Omicron is peaking, which does show a spike in January of both 2021 and 2022 successfully</li>
				<li>Visualization aims to show trends in new Covid-19 cases in the United States</li>
				<li>Peaks and troughs: peaks in January 2021, September 2022, January 2022</li>
				<li>Generally increasing trend, spiral structure allows for time continuity</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The spiral design effectively highlights important data, making it easy to spot spikes, especially in January 2021 and January 2022. The human eye naturally focuses on the center first and follows the spiral outward, creating a logical flow for interpreting trends. This layout also allows for comparisons between the same month in different years, such as COVID-19 cases in October 2021 vs. October 2022, helping to track year-over-year changes. The use of red shading reinforces the severity of higher case counts, aligning with the intuitive association of red with danger or caution. Additionally, the legend design is creative, using a triangle to represent the ratio between 0 and 150K cases, making the scale easier to grasp. The key takeaway is clear—another spike in January is coming, which makes this visualization well-suited for publication, as it effectively communicates its main point.
			</p>
			<p>
			The spiral structure, while visually engaging, may be confusing for the target audience, as curvature and depth are not the most effective expressive channels. The direction of the graph is not immediately clear—while arrows indicate movement for each year, a more intuitive guide, such as a continuous arrow along the black spiral or a red dot marking the start at 2020, would help direct the reader’s attention. Additionally, the use of straight arrows feels unintuitive for a circular layout; curving them to match the spiral would improve readability. Another challenge is that only four months (January, April, July, October) are labeled, requiring the reader to mentally track the timeline to decipher trends for other months. Labeling all months along the radial axes using consistent three-letter abbreviations (e.g., "Apr" instead of "April") would enhance clarity without overcrowding the visualization. The spiral also creates a depth illusion, similar to staring into a tunnel, making it seem as though values near the center (2020) are "further" away than those in 2022, which can distort perception of trends. This depth effect, combined with the circular layout, makes relative comparisons harder and magnitude estimation less effective than in a bar chart, where values are aligned for easy reading. The placement of the "7-day average" label in January 2021 is also unclear—it could be repositioned under the title with a brief explanation of whether it applies only to that point or across all data. Additionally, small inconsistencies, such as the uncapitalized title ("Cases") and the tight spacing between the legend and title, could be refined for better presentation. Finally, the symmetry of the shaded spiral area appears to be an aesthetic choice, but it’s unclear why it’s necessary—breaking that symmetry might even improve the visualization’s effectiveness.

			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: As a starting point, to fix the issues mentioned in my critique</li>
				<li>Hope to communicate: resolving previously made critiques for a more effective data visualization</li>

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        In Sketch 1, my main goal was to address critiques from earlier versions and enhance the effectiveness of the visualization. By using color contrast to differentiate arrows and years, I improved pre-attentive processing, making trends easier to follow. Additionally, curving the arrows and increasing their number reinforced the spiral’s directional flow, and the blue-highlighted years helped them stand out. While these refinements made the visualization clearer, the spiral structure still introduced issues with depth perception and trend misinterpretation. The radial axes also contributed to a cluttered appearance. Moving forward, I plan to explore an alternative visual form that enhances readability without sacrificing insight.
		</p>
			<p>
For Sketch 2, I aimed to make individual monthly data points more distinguishable, allowing for a clearer understanding of both monthly and yearly trends. By organizing COVID-19 case numbers in a structured grid, trends across months and years became more apparent. However, using circles for magnitude representation proved less intuitive, even with added shading for redundant encoding. Additionally, the sheer number of circles created a visual mess. To improve upon this design, I will explore a method that preserves time continuity while making trends more seamless and visually engaging.
		</p>
			<p>
With Sketch 3, I wanted to retain the time continuity of a spiral while avoiding depth perception issues. A circular bar chart format helped simplify comparisons across months and provided a cleaner, more intuitive design. Labeling each month around the circle improved readability, and the shape—reminiscent of COVID itself—offered a visually compelling structure. However, the circular format still limited direct comparisons between the same months across different years, which a linear x-axis would better facilitate. My next step will be to balance time continuity with improved comparative clarity, ensuring the visualization remains both insightful and aesthetically effective.

These sketches motivate me to maintain time continuity in my final sketch, communicate trends, and use tools like redundant encoding and visual pop-out to design a good visualization.

			<h3>Final Design Data Transforms</h3>

			<p>


Upon reading the spreadsheet, I was intrigued by the categories new_confirmed, new_deceased, and new_recovered. Since these columns are inherently related, I aimed to create a visualization that capitalized on their relationships. However, I needed clarification on the exact meanings of the column titles—did "deceased" imply the case had also been tested and confirmed? To better understand, I referred to the dataset’s <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data/blob/main/docs/table-epidemiology.md">metadata</a>. I learned that new_confirmed represents cases confirmed after a positive test on that date, new_deceased refers to deaths from a positive case on that date, and new_recovered represents recoveries on that date. However, this presented a problem: recoveries and deaths listed on a given date were not necessarily from the cases confirmed that day. To align these data points in a meaningful way, I transformed the dataset so that for each date, I could track cases occurring that day along with their respective deaths and recoveries. Using CDC data on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm">recoveries</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm#:~:text=Death%20data%20are%20approximately%2065,of%20when%20the%20death%20occurred">deaths</a>), I found that 65% of COVID-19 patients recover in 2–3 weeks and 65% of deaths occur within 2 weeks. Since this represents a majority, I shifted recoveries and deaths back by two weeks so that each row in the dataset reflects cases on that date along with their eventual outcomes.
      </p>
	<p>
On June 4, 2021, there was a negative value for new confirmed cases, which indicated an adjustment to the data. However, due to a lack of information on how the adjustment was made, I replaced that value with the average of the previous and next day’s confirmed cases (June 3 and June 5, 2021) to maintain accuracy without distorting trends. I applied the same approach for March 14, 2022, which had a negative value for new deaths. Additionally, the last three months of data contained numerous missing values, errors, and negative values, making it unreliable for trend analysis, so I removed those rows to improve clarity.
</p>
			<p>
Lastly, due to the large difference in scale between confirmed cases and deaths, I applied a log base 10 transformation to make trends more readable. For zero values, I set log(0) = 0 to avoid errors while preserving trends. This transformation helps balance the visualization, ensuring that all three data points—cases, recoveries, and deaths—can be interpreted effectively within the same graph.

</p>

      <h4>Final Design Decisions and Reflections</h4>

      <p>
By graphing area charts using the lines of new confirmed cases and deceased cases, I can communicate cases, deceased cases, and recovery cases trends all in one effective graph. I am most satisfied with my data transformations, as by shifting back deaths and recoveries by 2 weeks to align with the actual cases that occurred on those dates, we observe a nice alignment between the confirmed and deceased case trends. This makes it much easier to see where cases, deaths, and recoveries increase and decrease together, as it should logically be proportional by the number of cases. I also my y-axis on a logarithmic base 10 scale, which allowed for easier ease to see trends. While I did try exploring more complex graphs, I found that this area graph conveys the key trends, answering the question of how cases, recoveries, and deaths from COVID-19 evolve together over time.  My final data visualization is easy to interpret, and  my unique data transformation to align deaths and recoveries to the COVID cases that occurred on that date allowed for trends in recovery/death trends to be aligned with case trends. This graph is very easy to read for beginners and quite clear.  

      </p>
	<p>

	For size, I made the lines bold enough to be clear to see, but also narrow enough that you can notice fluctuations in cases of deaths even in short time periods. For color, blue line is used for confirmed cases, red line is used for deceased cases, red shaded area is for deaths, and blue shaded area is for recoveries. My goal for this visualization is to observe trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths, with a particular focus in deaths. This is communicated effectively by the redundant encoding of deaths (both red line and red shaded area) as well as the color red, which naturally stands out. I’m satisfied with my scale on the x-axis, as I can see trends by month clearly. It should be noted that I included grey vertical lines to better see the trends between different months. Although this worsens the data-ink ratio and makes the visualization slightly less clean, I think it's a worthwhile sacrifice in order to clearly see the trends between individual months, without having to overcrowd the labeling on the x-axis. This is fit for audiences or scientists who are curious about a specific number of cases, recoveries, or deaths in a specific month, or exact differences of value comparisons from month to month. I also decided against faceted displays as I saw no reason to break up the time continuous data, as the trends were also continuous. I also chose the appropriate aspect ratio to show trends across 3 years while still being able to see the individual variations within each month. I wanted to use direct labeling to show “Recoveries” and “Deaths” as the area under the graph, and use redundant color encoding as the same color shade as this area. I also utilized spatial alignment and large bold font to help readers see it.I considered rotating the y-axis label, but it stretches out the graph too much, and I didn’t find it necessary as the title is quite short and easy to read, even rotated. I gave a clear title, and also gave a subtitle to clarify that these recoveries and deaths shown are for the cases that first occurred that date, to prevent people from misinterpreting the graph or being confused. I made this in a lighter shade of grade and italics to not draw too much attention to it, as it is a longer string of text. 

	</p>
	<p>
		These decisions all facilitate effective communication by ensuring that COVID-19 case, recovery, and death trends are clearly represented and easily interpretable. The shifting of recovery and death data by two weeks helps align outcomes with their corresponding case dates, making the trends more logical. Using both lines and shaded areas for deaths and recoveries provides redundant encoding, reinforcing key information. Color choices—blue for confirmed cases, red for deaths—enhance clarity, while bold but narrow lines allow for precise trend tracking without visual clutter. The logarithmic y-axis transformation ensures that trends remain readable, though it requires viewers to understand how log scales impact relative proportions. Additionally, grey vertical lines improve month-to-month trend comparisons, even at the slight cost of a higher data-ink ratio. Direct labeling and a subtitle clarifying the time-shifted data help prevent misinterpretation. Together, these design choices balance clarity, readability, and accuracy in visualizing the progression of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.


	</p>
	<p>
		However, some aspects of the data may be downplayed due to these design choices. Because death and recovery data were shifted back two weeks, the last two weeks of data could not be included, slightly limiting trend completeness. The log scale effectively displays trends but distorts the perceived scale of cases vs. deaths, making it possible for those unfamiliar with logarithmic transformations to misinterpret the relative magnitude of deaths and recoveries. Additionally, using a fixed two-week translation for deaths and recoveries is a necessary approximation but does not account for individual variations—some people recover faster, while others may succumb to the disease after a longer period. Given more granular data, incorporating different variants, symptoms, or recovery periods could provide a more nuanced understanding.

	</p>
	<p>
		My final design successfully addresses many of the critiques from Step 2. It makes the reading direction clear (left to right), enables direct comparisons across months, and improves the positioning of key elements like titles, subtitles, and labels for better readability. While my design diverged significantly from the original spiral visualization, the process of “critique by redesign” was instrumental in identifying challenges in effectively presenting long-term trends without overwhelming the viewer and maintaining the ability to compare across time. However, one tradeoff is that my design does not allow for easy same-month comparisons across years—something the spiral design handled better. The spiral also had a strong focal point in the center and a more visually striking composition, making it engaging but harder to interpret at a glance. This experience highlighted that no single visualization is perfect—each design comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, and balancing tradeoffs is key to effective data visualization. Ultimately, this project reinforced the importance of audience considerations, design clarity, and iterative refinement in creating meaningful and informative visual representations of data.
